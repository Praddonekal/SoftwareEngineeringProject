Wits University COMS3002 - Software Engineering Project

The main objective of this project is to implement a prototype system for matching employers with job openings to prospective candidates with related skills.

The system evaluates some matric (in a form of percentage of match) of the applicant and the matrix as specified by the employer. The best matching candidate is then recommended to the employer. The procedue doesn't have to involve amy machine learning techniques, but if you can then by all means, go ahead.

Front-end:
1. Chuba G. Moganedi
2. Sammy Maakwana

Back-end:
1. Ntokozo Gule
2. Thabang Khoza

Languages and tools used for the project
1. Adobe Muse, PHP, HTML, CSS3 for front end interfaces
2. PHP for form validation, quering databases and computing the match
3. MySQL for the actual database and phpmyadmin
4. Apache Server
5. JSON for communication between the front-end and back-end
6. PHPstorm 
7. XAMPP

Introduction
Plan is to have two databases one for the employer and one for the students/ candidates.
The employer is going to feed the information of what they require the students/candidates to have in order to be eligible for an interview.
The candidates themselves will also have to fill in forms, so that their information will be captured in a different database. And then as the last step, the web app will do the matching of the candidates to listed job description per criteria.

The matching of the candidates and their respective job match will be matached using databases by linking the relative keywords then then matching or machine learning algorithms in php, then the result sent back to the front end for display.
