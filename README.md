The employer is going to feed the information of what they require the students/ candidates  to have in order to be eligible for an interview.
The candidates themselves will also have to fill in a form, so that their information will be captured in a different database. And then as the last step, the web app will do the matching of the candidates to listed job description per criteria.

The matching of the candidates and their respective job match will be matached using databases by linking the reletive keywords.
